        I have been playing since class 7. Thought it increased the heights of my peers so would do the same to me too. Was I right? Ahh yes.
        Don't know whether it was really playing basketball that increased my height to a mere 5' 10" or something else but for sure it taught me a lot just like any sport does.

                Started it because of my mother, continued it because of my liking and ended it because of getting a diploma in fine arts.
                Somehow completed 10 years of going to weekly classes even in classes 9 and 10 at times.

                I just like running (running from responsibilities too). I've won just one medal in athletics in my school life and if I still like it then there is something in it that keeps me from not running at times.
